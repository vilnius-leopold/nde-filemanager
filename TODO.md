- scroll on action panel
- integrated software center: application app
	--> one click uninstall
	--> click run
- search on type: dash/hud like location bar
	- application
	- file search
	- recent history
	- most used
	- inside current directory
- hide next/prev if not available
- hide up if in /home/leo or /root
- try async.sortBy for FileSorter.js
- try async.some for filtering
- second section for hidden files under non-hidden files
- fix reflow issues when resizing
	- location bar --> abs pos + overflow
	- files flickering --> abs pos + overflow
	- make content (scroll pane) span entire width --> avoid js resizing
		and put sidebar as overlay on top with content padding left
	- location bar / button container --> table cell display for dynamic resizing
- tabs
- [x] watch file system changes
- fix race condition for addbookmarks/opendir
	--> addbookmarks callback --> markbookmark
- [x] double check select implementation
	--> live select file items on selection overlay move --> to know better what your are selecting
	--> fix scrollable selection
- add directory/history memory
	--> view
	--> scrollbar position
	--> last selected item (for better keyboard navigation)
- fix row/tile view
	--> nde-file add row view
	--> add UI view button to toggle between row/tile view
	--> find efficiant way for switching view ( css class instead of looping through fileElement and setting attribute - might require shadow: selector from top level)
- fix slow loading of big directories (e.g. /home/leo/p)
- faster mimeType implemenation
	--> cache
	--> extension based mimeType detection (node mime module)
- add selection actions
	--> delete multiple files
- [x] release selection action (click on empty space)
- add copy/paste support
- open with support
- dir menu (paste / open in terminal)
- grouped view ( regular / hidden group )
- undo/redo ceate/delete files/folder
- uninstall apps via application view
	--> pacman -Qo $(which /usr/bin/firefox) // query package name via executable / desktop file name is usually the same as the name of the executable. Also check TryExec for executable path
	--> pacman -Qo /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop // query package via .desktop file
- [x] execute .desktop files:
	--> 1) http://askubuntu.com/questions/5172/running-a-desktop-file-in-the-terminal
	-->    ISSUES! --> check comments
	-->    find solution via .destkop spec / gtk implementation
	--> 2) http://askubuntu.com/questions/471282/is-it-possible-to-execute-a-desktop-file-from-a-quicklist
	-->    gtk-launch
- implement File types
	- [x] File
	- [x] DesktopFile
	- [x] Directory
	- SymLink
- remove bookmark type
	--> only on front-end: nde-bookmark (instead of backend bookmark file)
	--> add different renderer
- better mime lookup: find single process solution for mimedb command
	--> see 'file.js' 'getMimeType' function
	--> glib mime-server solution:
	--> https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/gio-GContentType.html#g-content-type-get-mime-type
	--> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1629172/how-do-you-get-the-icon-mime-type-and-application-associated-with-a-file-in-th/2170880#2170880
	--> possible directly combineable with icon-server to lower used resources ...but might block more... maybe better in separate server process. Also e.g. for sorting we might not need an icon but only the mimetype.
- desktop file open error handling
- make action sidebar scrollable
- back-button on left side of files window
- [x] read NoDisplay to determin if App is hidden or not.
- distribute files on entire width
	--> on resize calculate available columns. If extra space --> adjust margins
	--> looks nicer if no big space on right edge at action bar
- implement recent:// spec
- implement trash:// spec
- drap/drop files support
- fuse mount archives
- fuse mount torrents?
- mime-type determination: file --mime-type FILE_NAME
	file -i FILE_NAME
- mimetype related implementations in: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/shared-mime-info-spec/
--> under 'Current implementors'
- check gvfs and gio methods
	--> https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-vfs/2.24/gnome-vfs-2.0-gnome-vfs-mime-database.html
- fix keyboard navigation
	--> [x] for circular current selection
	--> [ ] scroll into view
- fix styles
	- hover + current
	- selected + current
	- hover + selected + current
	--> hover:    brighteness filter
	--> normal:   grey
	--> current:  blue
	--> selected: red
	--> current + selected: purple (mix red+blue)
